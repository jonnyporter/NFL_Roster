1. As a FAN of sports, I would like a dynamic roster where I can add/remove players from the list. So that I can visualize my sports team.
2. I would like a form so that I can add a player to my roster easily.
  - The form should have the following fields
    - Player Name
    - Player Position
    - Player Number
3. I would like the players added to show up in the roster section after being added.
