/* 11. Inside the player-roster div, add another dive with the class "player-card" 
  - Set the player-card class to "display:inline-block" and add a "1px solid black" border

12. Create a from inside the "player-form" div
13. Add an input field for Player Name, Position, and Number
14. When the add button is pressed, it should automatically add a player to the Roster.
15. Create a constructor for Player that accepts 3 arguments, Name, Position, Number.
16. When the Add button is pressed, a new player is created and added to the Players array.

1. As a FAN of sports, I would like a dynamic roster where I can add/remove players from the list. So that I can visualize my sports team.
2. I would like a form so that I can add a player to my roster easily.
  - The form should have the following fields
    - Player Name
    - Player Position
    - Player Number
3. I would like the players added to show up in the roster section after being added.
